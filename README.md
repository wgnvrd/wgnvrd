## Isabelle (Izzy) Wagenvoord 🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm senior at Colorado College studying computer science and minoring in mathematics. This summer, I am working as an undergraduate research assistant at the [MIDI Lab](https://www.midilab.org/). 

I enjoy singing, doing makeup, thrifting, listening to music, and coding! Next semester, I will study Chinese, political science and economics at Donghua University in Shanghai, China.
