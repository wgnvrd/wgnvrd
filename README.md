## Izzy Wagenvoord 🙋🏻‍♀️

I'm senior at Colorado College studying computer science and minoring in mathematics. Last summer, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant at the [MIDI Lab](https://www.midilab.org/), and last semester I studied Chinese, political science and economics at Donghua University in Shanghai, China. 

I enjoy singing, doing makeup, thrifting, listening to music, and coding!
